This is a personal program I began over winter break 2016-2017. It's a console application that acts as a fitness logger. As
of right now the program will construct a user profile, and log all of you're activities to a file in a nice format. If you 
already have a profile, it will read you're log file and construct you're profile when you sign in. I plan to add more
functionality to the program when I learn new programming languages and more advanced techniques.
