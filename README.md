# Active Version 1.0

This is a personal program I began over winter break 2016-2017. It's a console application that acts as a fitness logger. As
of right now the program will construct a user profile, and log all of you're activities to a file in a nice format. If you 
already have a profile, it will read you're log file and construct you're profile when you sign in.

## How to run it
`make run`
