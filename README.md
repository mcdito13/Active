This is a personal program I began over winter break 2016-2017. Essentially it's a console application that acts as a fitness logger. A lot of people, myself included, enjoy writing down their activities in a notebook and observing their progress over time. As of right now the program will construct a user profile, and log all of you're activities to a log file in a nice format. If you already have a profile, it will read you're log file and construct you're profile when you "sign in". I plan to add more functionality to the program when I learn new programming languages and technologies (such as a database in MySql, which I'll be taking this semester Spring 2017). The ultimate goal by the time I graduate is to have this application on all platforms (iOS, Android, Desktop, Web-Application, and Smart Watches). It is also serving as a fun project I can port to other languages. I've written up the classes in C# and begun development of a Windows Form Application. Unfortunately file reading/writing is a bit different than C++ (my primary langauge), so I'm putting this project on hold until I can implement a database to store and retrieve the data. Python and Java are the next two versions I will develop.
